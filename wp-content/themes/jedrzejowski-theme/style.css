Are You Serious? Yes.


MAKE SURE TO READ BELOW BEFORE GETTING STARTED FOR THE FIRST TIME!
------------------------------------------------------------------


http://roots.io/starter-theme (way more complex but has a ton of cool features)
http://html5reset.org (super clean and great markup)
https://github.com/viewportindustries/starkers (not sure if it's still active, but still good)

That's it. It's time to jump in and get your hands dirty.
Seriously, why are you still reading this? Get to work!
If you have any issues or problems, you can create an issue on github
or find me on Twitter: @eddiemachado (SHAMELESS PLUG!).

Happy Developing!

(When you're done, you may want to remove all this nonsense before
passing it along to your client.)
